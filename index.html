            <h4>President, Vice-President, Fundraising, Parent-helper</h4>

          <div class="work-description">
            <p>As a non-profit and a charity, this co-op preschool's business is handled by the current year's parents, with all parents taking on various roles to facilitate the functioning of the school.  As a non-profit and charity this requires some parents to take on board roles.  In my 5.5 years at Countryside I was President for 2 years, VP for 1, Fundraising and Class-Rep for another.  At one time I was in both the President and VP roles.  As Vp I was chair of the Personnel Committee and responsible for dealing with various complaints and personnel issues between parents and/or ECE.  I received special training for this 2 years in a row.  My skills were often times put to test but Countryside ran fairly smoothly for the years I was there.  The class-rep role is also part of the Personnel Committee and I was asked to stay in that role for my last year there.  All parents were required to help out in the classroom (2-4 times a month) as well as attend the board and/or general meetings and one hour of supplied parent education per month.  As President and sometimes VP I would be responsible for creating the agenda and chairing the meetings.  As Countryside has grown over the years my responsibilities included being part of important financial decisions to at first keep the preschool afloat, and as time went on to balance the income, governments grants and various financial decisions for the continual improvement of the preschool.  When I began my executive journey with the school we were at risk of shutting our doors due to low enrollment and during my time there we flourished, becoming a well-known and desired program with a 2 year waiting list.</p>
