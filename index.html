            <p>As a non-profit and charity this preschool requires parents to take on job duties to run the business of the school.  In my 5.5 years at Countryside I was President for 2 years, VP for 1, Fundraising and Class-Rep for another. As Vp and Class Rep I was chair of the Personnel Committee and responsible for dealing with various complaints and personnel issues between parents and/or ECE.  I received special training for this 2 years in a row.  Although for the most the school ran smoothly I did occassionally had to make good use of these skills in some serious matters.  As President and sometimes VP I would be responsible for creating the agenda, chairing the meetings and faciliting voting as well as being "the face" of the school.  As Countryside has grown over the years my responsibilities included being part of important financial decisions to at first keep the preschool afloat, and as time went on to balance the income, governments grants and various financial decisions for the continual improvement of the school.  When I began my executive journey with the school we were at risk of shutting our doors due to low enrollment and during my time there we flourished, becoming a well-known and desired program with a 2 year waiting list.</p>
